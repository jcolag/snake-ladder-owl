Snakes and Ladders versus the Owl

The theoretical goal, here, is to create a version of the venerable [Snakes and Ladders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders) game with...a costumed vigilante to make life more difficult, in this case, [the Owl](http://www.toonopedia.com/owl.htm).

The _real_ goal, of course, is to mess around with a couple of the JavaScript game libraries.  The candidates that seem the closest to what's needed for the project are [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) and [Phaser](https://phaser.io/).  So, there's a decent chance that there will be one version of the game (as far as it gets) using each library.
